# IoT Based Smart Noise Alert System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an IoT-based Smart Noise Alert System built using ESP8266 NodeMCU and Blynk Cloud.  
It monitors environmental noise levels and generates alerts when the threshold is exceeded.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time noise monitoring
- Threshold-based alert system
- Buzzer and LED indication
- Mobile notification via Blynk
- Cloud-based dashboard monitoring

## 🛠 Components Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- Sound Sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- WiFi connection

## ⚙️ Working Principle
When noise level exceeds the predefined threshold:
- Buzzer turns ON
- LED turns ON
- Notification sent via Blynk
- Dashboard shows "Noise Detected"

When noise level is normal:
- System displays "System Normal"

## 📊 Applications
- Exam hall monitoring
- Library silence monitoring
- Classroom discipline system
- Office noise control

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Data logging
- Email/SMS alerts
- AI-based noise analysis
